### Noteable Materials

- Ship png image
- The encrypted ZIP file containing the badge
- Story PDF file

### Briefing Clues

- An unidentified military vessel has been spotted near Taiwan. Given current geopolitical tensions, it is likely to be of Chinese origin.

### Flag format

***

### Steps

##### Step One:

Download and unzip the file:

`unzip naval-intrusion.zip`

You will find the materials previously mentioned. Run:

`file flagfile-nightmare-fuel.zip` 

You'll see that it is encrypted with AES so you need to find the password, i.e. the flag.

##### Step Two:

If you do a reverse image search on [google](https://www.google.com/) it will lead you to this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_054A_frigate) page. Let's try use the class as the flag.

##### Step Three:

Unzip the encrypted flag file:

`7z x flagfile-nightmare-fuel.zip`

Enter *type-054a-jiangkai-ii* into the password field â€” success! Grab your badge!
